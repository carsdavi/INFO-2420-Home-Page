<h3> What was your first impression of this site?</h3>
<br>
<h4>Answer:</h4>
<p>My first impression of their website was that it matched their persona as a store, it was designed and purposely made to match the rustic and fresh feeling of all their stores.</p>
<p> This is very well done as to overall design as they have previews of wanted items, pop ups for royalty memberships, accessible tabs/click-ons, different ways to interact with the site, and added their own media for customers to see.</p>

<br>

<h3>How does this site organize the flow of information? (Do they have links on the left and text on the right? Some other scheme? No scheme?)</h3>
<br>
<h4>Answer:</h4>
<p>They have bar that is on the left corner you can click on to open a tabloid of information on their products, recipes, etc. The top of the website has location status, information about the store, career opportunities, and announcements.</p>
<p>The main page includes their newly advertised products they want to showcase and push, that even includes recipes that include the newly added items to help market it.</p>

<br>

<h3>Does the site structure make sense or does it confuse you? Why?</h3>
<br>
<h4>Answer:</h4>
<p>The site structure makes sense because of how they structured their website to showcase all of their new items right on the new page, as stated earlier, they had a page link to direct customers to recipes with all of the featured items.</p>
<p>That creates more interaction within the site and is a great way to get customers in the stores. The structure is chock-full of bits and links that are placed in the way to create a "flow of traffic" with the customer.</p>

<br>

<h3>Does the site graphics/layout/multimedia enhance the site or detract from it? Why?</h3>
<br>
<h4>Answer:</h4>
<p>The graphics of the website are perfect I think, as I stated earlier in the first question, it matched it's persona of the Trader Joe's rustic, fresh, and refined. They also include a slideshow, podcast link, and videos for customers to interact</p>
<p>I think their implementation of media was their best trait/strongsuit when designing the website.</p>

<br>

<h3>How long did it take for the home page to load? Was the load time reasonable?</h3>
<br>
<h4>Answer:</h4>
<p>It took 1-2 seconds to load the home page, it was very quick. The other pages within the directory loads a tiny bit slower (2-5 seconds) but still quick to load.</p>

<br>

<h3>Was the text color and size readable? If a background color or image was used, did it enhance or detract from the site?</h3>
<br>
<h4>Answer:</h4>
<p>The text they used was all readable and used different sizing to catch attention to what they want you to see. They have thei main "header" with the Trader Joe's name on it alongisde 2-3 subheaders with text underneath to create spots of viewing for customers.</p>
<p>They had a background color top 1/4 of their home page to create a line or border. The color is a light deteriorated brown color to show another example of their rustic persona.</p>

<br>
<h3>Did the site have a navigation bar or other navigation tool? Was the navigation well done?</h3>
<br>
<h4>Answer:</h4>
<p>The website did have a navigation bar. Their navigation bar, once clicked, pops open and takes the whole screen over with a variety of options to click. It shows a list of all the different types of products you can click on to see what they have; from their bakery, cheeses, dairy, fruits, vegetables, etc.</p>
<p>The navigation bar also has a recipes you can go to, stories, subscriptions, guides, announcements, careers, contacts, and more</p>

<br>

<h3>Did the site have a color scheme or look and feel that was repeated on all the pages?</h3>
<br>
<h4>Answer:</h4>
<p>The color scheme on the website was very intruiging as they have very warm and old colors. Their main background color is an ivory color while they have some parts of a page that are a old deteriorated brown or light olive color to match their style.</p>

<br>

<h3>How does the site respond to smaller window sizes (responsive design)?</h3>
<br>
<h4>Answer:</h4>
<p>The sight responded very well to the window being smaller. Nothing seemed to lack speed or have any errors within the site.</p>
<p>The website moves and interacts as per usual in any size which is a great sign.</p>

<br>

<h3>What does this site offer that was unusual or very well done?
<br>
<h4>Answer:</h4>
<p>This website has really good interaction qualities, there is so much to interact with, whether it be media, links,or navigation; There is a lot to look at and choose from within this website.</p>
<p>Another great quality is how many interactive tools or widgets there are and the speed of the site has little to no slowing with all of them implemented in.</p>
